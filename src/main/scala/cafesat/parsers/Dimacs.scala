/*
 * This DIMACS parser might not exactly follow the standard, but since I am not sure where the
 * actual standard is, I figured out the best would be to just be able to support at least the format
 * used in some standard benchmark.
 *
 * First a comment line can occur at any point, and is simply ignored. It still has
 * to be a complete line starting with 'c'.

 * The problem line has to appear before any clause definition, else the input will
 * be rejected. The problem line is:
 * p cnf N M
 * where N and M are > 0 integer and N is the number of variables and M is the number of clauses

 * The clauses can span several lines and different clauses can be on the same line. Space and new lines
 * are basically ignored. The only separator that matters for clause is '0', which indicate the end of a clause.
 * If the last clause is not terminated by '0', then it will simply be ignored.

 * At the end, we verified that the number of clauses indead match the declared, and reject any output
 * that does not have enough clause. Actually, we don't do that yet, but we might in the future.
